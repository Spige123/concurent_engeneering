Concurent Engeneering

This subject was inspired by TU Delft course AE3211.
“Rocket engineering is not like ditch digging. With ditch digging you can get
100 people and dig a ditch, and you will dig it a hundred times as faster if you
get 100 people versus one. With rockets, you have to solve the problem of a
particular level of difficulty; one person who can solve the problem is worth an
infinite number of people who can’t.” Source - Interview with Elon Musk (2000s)

Deficiencies in Systems Engineering contribute to about 45% of failed products. Source – D. Verma, SpaceTech Lecture Notes (2004). Engineers are one of the company’s largest expenses in more ways than one. Salaries but also product recalls and inefficiencies due to design faults. Additional resources can be saved by improving the productivity of engineers. 

Products fail because:
1. The technologies do not have a market (the better mousetrap that nobody wanted 28%)
2. The “me as well” product (too late; 22%)
3. Competitive one-upmanship (ignoring competition; 22%)
4. Instable architecture (15%)
5. Price crunch (13%)

These can be attributed to lack of communication within the company and a lack of understanding of the customer or of the stakeholders. Therefore, a better way of development would include more communication within the team or company (less ridged structure) and more meeting with the stakeholders with a priority to understanding them.

“Customers are just a smaller part of a larger set of parties who affect or can
be affected by a system. These are called stakeholders.” -TU Delft definition. To that definition was attached the following sentence:” Understanding the needs of stakeholders is of utmost importance to the success of any project!”
Understanding the stakeholders and the needs of the stakeholder (stakeholder requirements) would then involve: 

• Understand the involved players

• Constrain the system to stakeholder requirements

• Understand the complex problem space.

The aim of these things is to improve the understanding stakeholder’s problem. Concurrent Engineering is the second peace of the puzzle increasing communication within the team. The two main ideas are:
1. To improve communication between the “user” and the “designer”
2. To set the design early on to eliminate the need to change it later in the design.

Implementation of concurrent engineering improved quality, providing quick, consistent, and complete mission design, incl. technical feasibility, programmatic, risk, cost. Technical report becomes part of the specs for subsequent industrial activity.
 Performances (typical pre-Phase A study):

• Study duration (Design phase): 3-6 weeks (before 6-9 months!)

• Factor 4 reduction in time

• Factor 2 reduction in cost (for the Customer)

• Increased # of studies per year; max. 2 parallel studies
